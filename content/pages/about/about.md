## Spellrise Team

We are a group of University students varying from different years. We're making a game for a club, and are inspired to make this game into a great piece of content. From an arrange of backgrounds, we were paired together as we joined UBC Game Development's project teams and have been working together collaboratively to bring the vision of the game to life. We are hard-working, communicative, cooperative and willing to receive feedback at every step of the way to improve. We're constantly looking for ways to improve ourselves and parts of the project that we work on.

## Project Team Lead
**Meaghan Marina**

Hi everyone! I'm currently a fourth year student at UBC studying a mix of creative arts, German, and business. Ever since I was a kid, I was playing games with my family and friends, or for my own pleasure. When I had my first computer science class, I knew right then that I wanted to make my passion with games a career. Since then, I've been making a lot of different game ideas, and this is one of my first steps into making my game idea into reality. I don't know what job specifically I aim to get, but I hope in the future I am working professionally making games.

**Ryan Reiss**

Hey everybody! My name is Ryan Reiss, I am a 4th year science student at UBC. I have always been a gamer at heart, with some of my earliest memories being of playing games on my family’s shared desktop computer. In more recent years, I’ve started teaching myself how to program in Unity, and that led me to UBC GameDev where I joined Mana Juice Studios! I aspire to one day work in the game development industry as a professional programmer or general designer.
